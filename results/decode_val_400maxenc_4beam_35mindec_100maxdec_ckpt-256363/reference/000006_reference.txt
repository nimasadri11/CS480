the id and ui presented the drawing of a prototype .
it is rounded , with the front made of hard plastic in different colours .
the back , as well as the lower part of the front are made of titanium .
the back has the logo and slogan of the company engraved in its middle .
the buttons include oval digit buttons , arrow - shaped channel and volume controls in the middle ; below those , is the menu ( for the lcd ) and the video button .
the lcd can be found at the lower section of the device .
after the presentation , the product was evaluated .
this was done on a scale of 1 ( excellent ) - 7 ( very bad ) on fancifulness , ease of use , finding the device when it is lost , hi-tech features , incorporation of fashion trends , and ergonomic design .
because it was over budget , titanium was replaced by plastic and the speech recognition was discarded .
they thought it would have been more sensible to have the component costs before the prototype design .
finally , the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity ( generally satisfied ) , leadership ( the process was democratic , not happy with management ) , teamwork ( happy with it ) , and means ( smartboard was ' a disaster ' and the digital pens only good for drawings ) .
