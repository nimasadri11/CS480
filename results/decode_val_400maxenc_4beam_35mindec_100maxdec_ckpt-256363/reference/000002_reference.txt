the project manager opened the meeting and then the user interface designer and industrial designer presented their prototype for the remote which featured an lcd screen , a scroll button , and a battery indicator .
the marketing expert conducted a project evaluation of the prototype .
the team found the remote to be fancy , innovative , fairly easy to use , available in different colors , fairly spongy , difficult to misplace , and targeted to younger people .
the project manager then led the team in calculating the production costs of their remote .
the team had difficulty in meeting the the target cost and had to eliminate some of the more expensive components they had hoped to include in their design .
the project manager then led the team in an evaluation of the project process .
the team found the project stressful , the equipment useful , the information available to them lacking , and their laptops to be slow and heavy .
