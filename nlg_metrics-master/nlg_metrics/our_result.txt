the project manager gave an agenda for the project as a whole .he presented an agenda for the rest of the rest , beginning with the group will decide on the basis of budget .the industrial designer gave a presentation on the basic components of a remote .the industrial designer presented options for batteries and energy sources and an energy source .he presented all the necessary internal components of a remote control device on the basis of using a radio station .the group discussed voice recognition and other capabilities to include in their design ,
g2
there are some new requirements for the project : the device will have to be for tv only , they should ignore the teletext function , as it is dated , and , also , the remote should be recognisable as a real reaction product .the target group will be people below 40 .the ui preferred an easy - to -use remote to a multi-function one .the function of the remote is relatively simple : by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip , and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver ( the tv ) via infrared .the use of infrared , energy - efficient power source and cheap circuit was suggested .the remote could light up via led 's placed inside .functions like zapping are very prevalent , as well as complaints about remotes being easy to lose .it also transpires that customers like innovative technology like speech recognition .the design can focus on such customer needs , like finding a mechanism to locate a lost remote .the functions of the remote will include a back button to switch between two channels , volume , program selection , and speech recognition , with a focus on simplicity of design .

the meeting begins and the marketing expert starts her presentation promptly , telling them that her research shows they need a focus - it is not possible to make a device that works on the whole house .the project manager steps in and informs them that they have instructions to eliminate the teletext idea because it is too complicated , and also said they must maintain the corporate image by using corporate designs and colors .the marketing expert resumes , talking about how remotes often get lost and that a light emitter might be useful .the industrial designer gives her presentation , talking about components , materials , and energy sources .they discuss giving the control different shapes to suit both adults and children , making the buttons various shapes , and putting a display clock on the control .the interface designer presents , talking about the features users like on a remote and suggesting that they make the remote a t-shape and add an alarm clock function .they discuss their target group and the possibility of removable plastic cases .they close the meeting deciding to do more research on the plastic cases .

the top goal of this m um we will figure that out this m um we will tell you about it .`` um we are not even going to try to um , '' yeah. um the top goal of this m um we have to deal with .um the third requirement is that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .
g2
there are some new requirements for the project : the device will have to be for tv only , they should ignore the teletext function , as it is dated , and , also , the remote should be recognisable as a real reaction product .the target group will be people below 40 .the ui preferred an easy - to -use remote to a multi-function one .the function of the remote is relatively simple : by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip , and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver ( the tv ) via infrared .the use of infrared , energy - efficient power source and cheap circuit was suggested .the remote could light up via led 's placed inside .functions like zapping are very prevalent , as well as complaints about remotes being easy to lose .it also transpires that customers like innovative technology like speech recognition .the design can focus on such customer needs , like finding a mechanism to locate a lost remote .the functions of the remote will include a back button to switch between two channels , volume , program selection , and speech recognition , with a focus on simplicity of design .
